# Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking: PIE Bypass Techniques and Mitigations

This repository contains the coursework for an analysis of Position Independent Executables (PIE), focusing on their role in preventing buffer overflow attacks. The project explores various techniques to bypass PIE protections and suggests enhancements to improve system security.

## Key Features:
- **Overview of PIE**: Understanding how PIE works and its integration with Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for security.
- **Bypass Techniques**: Demonstration of methods to bypass PIE protections using practical code examples.
- **Mitigations**: Recommendations for improving PIE's security with layered defensive strategies.

## Files Included:
- **Code**: Exploit examples and scripts demonstrating PIE bypass techniques.
- **Report**: Detailed analysis of PIE's vulnerabilities and suggested improvements.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **GCC**: Used to compile C programs with and without PIE enabled.
- **GDB**: For debugging and memory analysis.
- **Python (Pwntools)**: Automating exploit creation and memory address manipulation.

## Conclusion:
The research confirms that while PIE offers valuable security, it can be bypassed with advanced techniques. The study emphasizes the need for multi-layered defenses to ensure comprehensive protection against modern cyber threats.
